# Google Calendar Connects
This is the project assignment done using custom build simple MVC pattern structure (Model is not included as no database is used) and Google Calendar integration (only create, list and delete of events).

Base features:

* Simple MVC pattern design with basic routing.
* Integration with PHP Google Client API to connect and disconnect user.
* Use of Google Calendar Service to create, list and delete events.
* Basic Session, Validation and Helper are used.

Note:

* Due to PHP version Google Client may show some errors. [Some Google Client Core codes have been changed.]
* While publishing status is set to "Testing" on OAuth consent screen, only test users(gmails) are able to access the app. Publishing status to Production can remove this. [From Credentials here, This app has publishing status "Testing"]
